# Navigate_HT
This my first IOS app with a long history just in one day as follows:
1) I created a Virtual Mashine running MacOS catalina (10.15.5) on my host PC (windows 10)
2) I formatted a USB on Virtual MacOS.
3) From Apple web site, I downloaded MacOS 10.13.6 which is the latest version of MacOS 
   as being compatible with my old MacBook Air 4,1 - mid 2011.
4) I created a MacOS bootable USB containing MacOS 10.13.6
5) I plugged the bootable USB into my MacBook Air which runs Windows 7.
6) I started my MacBook Air keeping pushing the option key.
7) I erased windows SSD and created a MacOS SSD using MacOS's disk utility.
8) I installed MacOS onto the newly created disk.
9) From the Apple site, I downloaded XCODE IDE 10.1 which is the highest version working on MacOS 10.3.6 (the latest version of XCODE is 12.0)
10) I created a SWIFT based application with two pages showing my pictures.
11) I download the free SVN tool "Sourcetree" version 3.2.1 which is the highest version working on MacOS 10.3.6 (As of today, the latest version is 4.1)
12) Using Sourcetree I created a local .git, defined SSH public key for my MacBook and pushed my app to my GitHub (i.e. here)
    (P.A: Sourcetree creates "master" branch as default in contrary to the "main" branch created by Github as Default since January 2021)
13) I changed the default branch from "main" to "master" in Github using Settings of my repositoty "Navigate_HT".
14) Finaly I have written this README.md file in order to recall in the future what I have done to complete this challenge.
15) I plan to develop next versions of this simple application using the free "React Studio IDE" in "React Native" language. 

Attached are screenshots of my App in XCODE IDE together with running versions on an Apple Mobile Emulator.
