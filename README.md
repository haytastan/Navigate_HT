This my first IOS app with a long history just in one day as follows:
1) I created a Virtual Mashine running MacOS catalina (15.5) on my host PC (windows 10)
2) I formatted a USB on Virtual MacOS.
3) From Apple web site, I downloaded MacOS 10.13.6 which is the latest version of MacOS 
   as being compatible with my old MacBook Air 4,1 - mid 2011)
4) I created a MacOS bootable USB containing MacOS 10.13.6
5) I plugged the bootable USB into my MacBook Air which runs Windows 7.
6) I started my MacBook Air keeping pushing the option key.
7) I erased windows SSD and created a MacOS SSD using MacOS's disk utility.
8) I installed MacOS onto the newly created disk.
9) I downloaded XCODE from Apple web site.
10) I created a SWIFT based application with two pages showing my pictures.
11) I download sourcetree version 3.2.1 which is the highest I can go with MacOS 10.3.6 (the latest version as of today is 4.1)
12) Using Sourcetree I created a local .git, defined SSH public key and pushed my app to GitHub.
    (P.A: Sourcetree creates master branch as default in contrrary to main branch created by Github as Default since Janunary 2021)
13) I changed the default branch from main to master in Github using Settings of the repositoty.
14) Finaly I have written this README.md file in order to recall in the future what I have done.
